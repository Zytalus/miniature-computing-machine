# Tic-Tac-Toe React App

This project was created following a [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## At the end of the tutorial there was a list of features to be added.

All features have been implemented.
- Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
